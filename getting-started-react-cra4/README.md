# Getting Started with Metaplex and CRA 4

This example sets up a React app with Metaplex using "Create React App" (CRA) version 4 â€” i.e. using Webpack 4. Note that, if you're starting a new project, we recommend using CRA 5 which uses Webpack 5.

This example has been generated using the following steps:

1. Create a new project using the "Create React App" command.
    ```sh
    npx create-react-app getting-started-react-cra4 --scripts-version 4.0.3
    cd getting-started-react-cra4
    ```

2. Install the Metaplex and the Solana SDKs.
    ```sh
    npm install @metaplex-foundation/js-next @solana/web3.js
    ```
