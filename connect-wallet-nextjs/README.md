# Getting Started with Metaplex and Next.js

This example sets up a new React app with Metaplex using Next.js.

This example has been generated using the following steps:

1. **Create a new project using Next.js.**
    Redirect to [this](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/js-examples/tree/main/getting-started-nextjs) link to know how to create next.js application and install metaplex successfully.

2. **Install the needed dependencies.**

   ```sh
    npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-base \
         @solana/wallet-adapter-react \
         @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui \
         @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
   ```

3. **That's it!** ðŸŽ‰

   You're now ready to start building your app. You can use the following commands to build and serve your app.

   ```sh
   # Build and serve for development.
   npm run dev

   # Build and serve for production.
   npm run build && npm run start
   ```
